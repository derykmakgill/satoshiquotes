### Looking for a citation

Satoshi's first [confirmed email](https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/2008-nakamoto) was sent to cypherpunk and 'b-money' author Wei Dai. 

Satoshi asks Dai for a citation for his Bitcoin whitepaper, suggesting he only found out about the ideas in 'b-money' after he was told of them by Adam Back.

I was very interested to read your b-money page.  I'm getting ready to
release a paper that expands on your ideas into a complete working system.
Adam Back ([hashcash.org](http://hashcash.org)) noticed the similarities and pointed me to your
site. <br><br>I need to find out the year of publication of your b-money page for the
citation in my paper.  It'll look like:
[1] W. Dai, "b-money," [http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt), (2006?).

**Fun fact:** *Wei Dai himself has said that he does not think Satoshi was inspired by b-money. He thinks Bitcoin was an independent creation from previous attempts at making digital cash and that Satoshi back-credited people like him in the paper.*

### A pre-release draft
The earliest draft of the white paper was called 'Electronic Cash' not 'Bitcoin.'

{:.highlight}
  
We don't have this document anymore, but it makes clear Satoshi's intentions: to create a form of electronic cash.
